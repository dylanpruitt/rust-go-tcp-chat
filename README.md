# Simple TCP Chat Server/Client

I've gone through the official tutorials for both Rust and Go, but wanted to work on a project to have hands-on experience with both. I thought making a simple chat app with both languages would be a great way to compare the two.

This repo builds off of two similar existing repos:  
Go TCP Server/Client (https://github.com/jeroendk/go-tcp-udp)  
Rust TCP Server/Client (https://github.com/EleftheriaBatsou/chat-app-client-server-rust)

- username input
- loop until :quit is input (Go)
- show user:message as string on client end
